# Clinical-Records-Data-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Models-Machine-Learning-Interpretability-
This project is the analysis of a clinical records dataset for heart failure patients. We performed data cleaning and preprocessing, and then visualized the data using matplotlib and seaborn to understand it better.
We then performed machine learning algorithms/models such as xgboost, logistic regression, random forest and decision trees to predict the outcomes and accuracies. 
We also performed feature importance to highlight which feature contributes the most to the target value which is the death event.
After creating the models, we then performed Machine Learning Interpretability using ELI5, Lime and SHAP for further insights on the data and the models.

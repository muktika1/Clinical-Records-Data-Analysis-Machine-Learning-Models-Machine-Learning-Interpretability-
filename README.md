# Clinical Data Analysis and Interpretability with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing clinical records data to derive insights and apply machine learning models to predict patient outcomes. Additionally, it emphasizes model interpretability to ensure that the predictions made by the models are understandable and actionable in a clinical context.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
    - Cleaned and transformed the clinical records dataset to prepare it for analysis and modeling.
    - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Conducted thorough EDA to understand the distribution of the data, relationships between features, and potential patterns.
    - Visualized key metrics using plots to highlight significant trends and insights.

- **Feature Engineering:**
    - Created new features based on domain knowledge to enhance the predictive power of the models.
    - Applied dimensionality reduction techniques to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and improve model performance.

- **Modeling:**
    - Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost) to predict patient outcomes.
    - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

- **Model Interpretability:**
    - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Utilized SHAP values to interpret the predictions of the machine learning models and understand feature importance.
    - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Applied LIME to provide local explanations of individual predictions, offering insights into specific cases.
    - **ELI5:** Used ELI5 to visualize and interpret feature importances and model predictions, enhancing the transparency of the models.

- **Model Optimization:**
    - Fine-tuned models through hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
    - Cross-validated models to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.
